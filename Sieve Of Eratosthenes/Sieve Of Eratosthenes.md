## ***It is one of the mose simple and efficient algorithm to find the prime numbers for a given set of limit.***

### Working of the algorithm:
##### The working of algorithm is very simple.

**Step 1:** First we write down all the numbers from 2 to n.

**Step 2:** From the first prime number i.e “2”, we strike out / remove all the numbers that are divisible by 2 till “n”.

**Step 3:** Then go to the next prime number, now strike out the numbers that are divisible by the present prime number till the square of the present prime number.

**Step 4:** Repeat step 3, till you reach the end.

**Step 5:** You will get the list of all the prime numbers.
